In February 2023, we visited Gateway Arch National Park, and it left me with mixed feelings. While I typically look forward to exploring vast natural landscapes in national parks, Gateway Arch presented a stark contrast with its historical and architectural focus. Initially, I wasn't sure if it met my expectations of what a national park should be. However, having friends with me made the experience much more enjoyable. Their company transformed the visit into a fun and memorable adventure, helping me appreciate the unique qualities of the park in a new light. It was a reminder that sometimes, itâ€™s the people you're with who make all the difference in how you experience a place. 
So, rather than focusing on just the national park, this trip was dual-purpose for me, catch up with friends while also visiting a national park. And I must say, it was a very hectic but fulfilling weekend. 

Here's how the weekend unfolded:

- **Thursday Afternoon:** Worked in office until about 4 PM EST, then drove approximately 7.5 hours to Edwardsville, IL, with my husband.
- **Thursday Night:** Arrived at our friend's place around 11 PM, enjoyed a home-cooked dinner, and watched a 2-hour movie. Kudos to my energy level. 
- **Friday:** Worked remotely until 4 PM CDT, then officially started our weekend adventure. During the day, we were eating delicious homemade donuts and coffee for breakfast and rice and curry for lunch. 
- **Friday Evening:** Explored St. Louis, visiting Gateway Arch and taking the tram up for breathtaking views and historical insights. Also explored the museum at the national park. Despite the crowd and cramped conditions, the $15 tram fee was well worth it.
- **Friday Night:** Celebrated a friend's birthday, adding a festive note to our journey. 
- **Saturday:** More exploration in St. Louis, including a visit to the exceptional free-entry zoo, featuring a memorable encounter with a polar bear. Meet some friends for breakfast, then drove to Fulton, MO. The drive was approximately 2 hours. Picked up our friends and went to explore Jefforson City, MO. 
- **Sarurday Night:** Enjoyed homecooked biryani (two versions by two friends), had awesome margaritas, just had overall fun. 
- **Sunday:** Drove to Edwardsville,IL after breakfast. Then back home to Knoxville, TN. We reached home after dark. 
- **Sunday Night:** Got rest for work the next day. 

## What I Missed
Despite being an optimistic planner, time constraints prevented a visit to the Ozarks. However, I managed to visit it later in another trip. 

## Culinary Highlights
We indulged in a variety of delicious foods over the weekend:
- Homemade biryanis and margaritas
- Freshly made momo
- Homemade Donuts and Coffee
- Street-style pizza
- Rich, comforting Lakota Coffee

## Expenses
- **Gas:** $200 (Carpooled to Missouri, leaving our car in Edwardsville)
- **Gateway Arch:** $30 for two (No national park pass needed)
- **Food:** $300 (Included groceries and eating out)
- **Total:** Approximately $500 for the weekend for two people

## Travel Route

We drove about 21 hours ;) 

## Ease of Visit
The park is straightforward to visit and doesn't require much planning, making it ideal for those looking to quickly tick it off their list of national parks.

## Season and Driving Conditions
While we visited in February and the park is accessible year-round, adding a trip to the Ozarks is best in the summer.

## Final Thoughts
While Gateway Arch may feel more like a national monument than a park, the experience is unique and memorable. For anyone planning a visit, I highly recommend integrating other activities or visits into your itinerary, as the mix of zoo visits, catching up with friends, and touring significant local landmarks made for a fulfilling, albeit tiring, weekend.
