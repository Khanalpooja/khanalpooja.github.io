# What do you do on weekends? 

Last weekend, my husband playfully teased me for planning yet another weekend trip that involved over 15 hours of driving. That moment made me realize just how many of our weekends have been packed with long drives. This sparked the idea to share these experiences with others who also thrive on the thrill of travel and the joy of discovering new places on the go.

For those unfamiliar, traveling in the USA often means relying heavily on a car. Public transportation options can be limited, depending on where you are. While I have quite a few thoughts on the need for better public transit in the US, perhaps that's a topic best saved for another blog post. For now, let’s dive into the joys and challenges of road tripping across this vast country.

First, Let me define what a weekend means to me—a span of 2-3 days, usually without taking official vacation days from work. Thanks to my hybrid work schedule, I've had the flexibility to work from almost anywhere some days, which has allowed me to blend travel with my daily responsibilities seamlessly. 

The travel bug in me is relentless, always pushing me to discover new places and seize every chance to explore. I'll share tips from my day-to-day travels and my most recent adventures, with a special love for the national parks across the USA. Over the years, I've embarked on numerous national park trips, mostly involving camping, and each one has been incredible. Let’s talk about what I did, what I would do differently on future visits, and how you can tailor your travel pace and preferences—whether you're like me, always on the move, or prefer to take it slow and soak in each moment. From solo trips to journeys with my husband and close-knit circle of friends, each adventure has its own unique flavor and lessons learned. 

This series is where I share my whirlwind weekend travel experiences. Balancing full-time work with a passion for travel is no small feat, and honestly, it's not for everyone. My trips, often packed into weekends or slightly longer spans, are fast-paced by necessity—we have a lot of ground to cover, and there's no time to waste! Now that I'm on a break, I've had the opportunity to reflect on these experiences. Dive into my itineraries, explore the Google Maps routes I've charted, and check out my budgeting strategies for each journey. I also have a gift - I can fall asleep anywhere. My friends, who often host me, understand my need for these brief escapes—they're weekend warriors themselves, so it works out well for everyone and keeps our friendships strong.
