In March 2022, I turned a family wedding in California into a chance for a solo journey across the stark and awe-inspiring deserts of Southern California. Exploring Joshua Tree National Park and Death Valley, I was surrounded by unique landscapes—from the intriguing rock formations of Joshua Tree to the expansive salt flats of Death Valley. This trip became more than just sightseeing; it was an exploration of independence and personal growth amidst some of the most serene yet challenging environments.

## Day 1: Arrival and Joshua Tree National Park

Having finished work early at 2 PM PDT (thanks to my work being on EST), I picked up a rental car and headed to Joshua Tree, a two-hour drive from Tustin, where I was staying with family. I arrived at the Joshua Tree visitor center by 5 PM, just as the sun began to set. Although it shortened my planned activities, the early night sky was beautiful. After exploring, I visited a nearby grocery store and then settled into my Airbnb in Desert Hot Springs. It was my first time staying alone in an Airbnb, but the warmth and simplicity of the place quickly put me at ease.

## Day 2: Exploring Joshua Tree and Heading to Pahrump

I started the day early, eager to take in as much as possible. My stops included:

- **Cap Rock Nature Trail**: A 0.3-mile loop showcasing Joshua trees and distinctive rock formations.
- **Keys View**: Offers sweeping views of Coachella Valley and distant mountain ranges.
- **Hidden Valley Nature Trail**: A scenic 1-mile loop surrounded by striking rock formations.
- **Skull Rock and Split Rock**: Notable rock formations that provide easy exploration opportunities.
- **Cholla Cactus Garden**: Features dense growths of cholla cactus against a mountainous backdrop, perfect for photographers.

Fueled by snacks and Diet Coke, I left Joshua Tree in the mid-afternoon for Pahrump, Nevada. The drive through the beautiful Mojave National Preserve was breathtaking. I arrived at my Airbnb around 9 PM, where my host provided invaluable tips for my upcoming visit to Death Valley.

## Day 3: Death Valley National Park and Return to Tustin

After some morning work and a quick snack of lemon cake and coffee provided by my host, I drove into Death Valley. It was a serene 1.5-hour drive. Highlights included:

- **Dante's View**: Offers panoramic views over Death Valley from the Black Mountains, accessible via a short walk from the parking area.
- **Badwater Basin**: North America's lowest point at 282 feet below sea level, featuring expansive salt flats accessible from the parking lot.
- **Devil’s Golf Course**: Jagged rock salt formations visible from a brief walk near the parking lot.
- **Artist's Palette**: Showcases colorful mineral deposits along a scenic drive with short, accessible paths.
- **Zabriskie Point**: Famous for its striking views of Death Valley's golden badlands, just steps from the parking area.
- **Mesquite Flat Sand Dunes**: Easily accessible dunes for walking and photos;
- **Mosaic Canyon**: offers a 2-mile round-trip hike through narrow marble walls.

The vastness of Death Valley at night and the lack of other creatures or cars heightened the solitude and thrill of the journey. The disconnect from cell service added to the adventure, though it did bring a touch of nervousness as I was unable to inform my family of my expected arrival time. Eventually, finding a lone gas station allowed me to reconnect and assure them of my safety, bringing a sense of relief as I continued my journey under the night sky.


## What I Missed
On my trip to Death Valley National Park, I missed exploring **Ubehebe Crater**, a striking volcanic feature. It's definitely on my itinerary for my next adventure in the park.

## Ease of Visit
- **Death Valley**: Visiting requires thoughtful planning due to sparse amenities, isolated roads, and extreme weather conditions. Proper preparation is essential for a safe and enjoyable experience in this rugged terrain.
- **Joshua Tree**: This park is easily accessible and perfect for a quick day trip from Los Angeles or its suburbs. It offers a straightforward, minimal planning experience, making it ideal for last-minute outings.

## Weather Considerations
- **Death Valley**: As the hottest place on earth with temperatures soaring to 130°F, it's advisable to avoid summer trips. I visited in March when it was 90°F and found hydration to be key, so always bring plenty of water, even during cooler months.
- **Joshua Tree**: Located in the Mojave Desert, Joshua Tree is cooler than Death Valley. It's best visited during the cooler months or when the weather is mild, ensuring a comfortable exploration.

## Final Thoughts
Traveling solo is an exhilarating experience that brings with it unique challenges. It's essential to keep someone informed about your location and travel plans, ensuring you have a safety net despite the solitude. Choosing a hybrid car proved invaluable, as its efficiency was a boon across the extensive desert drives. Although driving through Death Valley at night was an electrifying adventure, I would advise caution for solo travelers due to the inherent safety risks. Being prepared for emergencies, such as knowing how to change a tire, is also crucial.

This journey not only led me through breathtaking landscapes but also imparted lessons in preparation and self-reliance. Facing and overcoming unexpected challenges, I grew personally and gained new insights into my capabilities. This trip offered not just a visual feast of awe-inspiring places but also a profound opportunity for personal growth and the creation of lasting memories. The weather in March was ideally suited for exploring Death Valley, making the experience all the more enjoyable.
