## Day 1: Mammoth Hot Springs and Grand Canyon of Yellowstone

&nbsp;

Start from the west entrance of the park and head towards Madison. Follow the upper circle from the Madison Junction (refer the map with the points below) . Also, I have added optional attractions along the way you might want to checkout if you have time. 


### Stops along the way 
   ##### 1. Madison Information Station
   You will enter aorund here. You might start spoting wildlife , maybe bears as well. Although we mostly saw bisons.

    &nbsp;
           
   ##### 2. [optional] Monument Geyser 
   
        This is a 2.4 mile round hike and this is the peek at the geothermal activities around yellowstone.  

   ##### 3. [optional] Artist Paint Pots

    />
        
        This is a 1.1 mile loop and is a great spot to see the mud pots and the colors of the springs. 
    
   ##### 4. Norris Geyser Basin 

    <PostCard

    alt="Norris Geyser Basin"
    caption="Norris Geyser Basin"

    />

        The overall hike is 2.9 mile loop and you get to see various different kind of geysers and hot springs here. Look out for Steamboat Geyser which is the tallest active geyser in the world. 

   ##### 5.  Roaring Mountain

   <PostCard

    />
        You can view the roaring mountain from the parking lot. So, it's definitely worth a stop.

   ##### 6.  Mammoth Hot Springs 

    <PostCard 
    src="/national-parks/yellowstone/mammoth_hot_spring.jpg"
    alt="Lower Terrace - Mammoth Hot Springs"
    caption="Lower Terrace Mammoth Hot Springs"

    />

        Mammoth hot springs is one of my favorite spots in the park. The terraces are beautiful and you could see deers and elks around the area as well. The total hike for the two terraces(lower and upper terrace) is 2.5 miles and its definitely worth taking your time to explore both but if you had to pick one, do the lower terrace.
    

   #####  7. Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone 

   <PostCard 
    src="/national-parks/yellowstone/grand_canyon_ys.jpg"
    alt="Grand Canyon of Yellowstone"
    caption="Grand Canyon of The Yellowstone"

    />

        I could barely take my eyes off the Lower Falls from the artist point. It feels majestic and the color in the canyon feels like someone has actually splashed colors in there. 
        Also, it's worth checking out inspiration point.  


### Where to eat and what to eat on the first day? 

- Mammoth Hot Springs – Try the elk burger and huckleberry ice cream
- Canyon Village Lodge – Try the bison burger and huckleberry ice cream again! 
They have other options for food as well and you can pick up snacks from the visitor stores as well, but plan ahead as the stores might be closed and there are only two dining options along the way - mammoth hot springs and canyon village. 


### Where to stay the first night?
- Canyon Village Campsite 
- Canyon lodge if you are not a camping person 


## Day 2: Old Faithful, Grand Prismatic and more geysers 


    ##### 1. Hayden Valley 

    <PostCard

    alt="Hayden Valley"
    caption="Hayden Valley reminded me of Moomin Valley"

    />
        You'll drive through the Hayden Valley and it does Feel straight out of a dream. If you’ve seen Moomin, this landscape have me a similar vibe as the Moomin Valley. 

    


    ##### 2. [Optional] Sulphur Caldron

    ##### 3. [Optional] Mud Volcano

    ##### 4. Yellowstone Lake

       <PostCard 
    src="/national-parks/yellowstone/ys_lake.jpg"
    alt="Yellowstone Lake"
    caption="Yellowstone Lake"

    />
        Stop anywhere by the lake and grab in the wide view of the Yellowstone lake. Also stop for continental divide once you drive past the lake. 

    ##### 5. Old Faithful 

    <PostCard 
    src="/national-parks/yellowstone/old_faithful.jpg"
    alt="Old Faithful Geyser"
    caption="Old Faithful Geyser"

    />

    If you could only see one thing in Yellowstone, I would recommend the Old Faithful Geyser. This geyser erupts roughly every 90 minutes and  even if you miss the last eruption, it's worth the wait for the next eruption. You can check eruption times at the Old Faithful Visitor Center or online at geysertimes.org.

    I could write a whole blog on just the old faithful but I encourage you to go and see it for yourself.

    ##### 6. Geyser Basins 

     <PostCard 
    src="/national-parks/yellowstone/grand_prismatic.jpg"
    alt="Grand Prismatic Spring"
    caption="Grand Prismatic Spring"

    />

    - Upper Geyser Basin

   -  [Must See] Midway Geyser Basin
   
    The Grand Prismatic Spring is a highlight here and it’s one of the most photographed spots in the park. Grand Prismatic is what everyone pictures when they hear Yellowstone. Also, don’t miss the Grand Prismatic Overlook Trail which is a 1.2 mile round trip hike that gives you an amazing view of the spring and the surrounding landscape.

    - Lower Geyser Basin

    Be on the lookout for Deep Blue Geyser. 
 
    ##### 7. West Thumb Geyser Basin

       <PostCard

    alt="Lakeshore Geyser in West Thumb" 
    caption="Lakeshore Geyser in West Thumb"

    />

        The entire trail is less than a mile. And you'll see the geysers along the lake which will be an interesting experience in itself to see how the geysers blend with the lake.



### Where to eat and what to eat on the second day?
- Old Faithful Lodge
- Grant Village Lodge

They have local dishes (read elk, bison and huckleberry) but have other foods as well.  

### Where to stay the second night?
- Lewis Lake Campsite
- Grant Village Lodge if you are not a camping person

     <PostCard

    />
        Enjoy the serene lake with the tetons in the background. 

    ##### 2. Elk Ranch Flats Turnout 
         This area is often good for spotting elk and other wildlife. It is also a good photospot for views of tetons. 

    ##### 3. Schwabacher Landing 
        This is a great spot for photography with the reflection of the Tetons in the water.

    ##### 4. Jenny Lake 


  <PostCard

    alt="Jenny Lake" 
    caption="Jenny Lake"

    />

        Take the boat across Jenny Lake and hike to Inspiration Point. It's a scenic and less than 2 mile hike but you have to get the boat tickets to reach the trailhead. The boat ride is also a great experience to soak in the beauty of tetons.

    ##### 5. Glacier View Turnout

## Ease of Visit

Both national parks are easily accessible by car in the summer. The roads are also well-maintainedHowever, be prepared for long drives between attractions, especially in Yellowstone and start super early. 

## Season and Driving Conditions
The best time to visit Yellowstone and Grand Tetons is during the summer or spring and fall. The snow gets cleared around May, so plan after that though. Summer is the peak season, so expect larger crowds and higher prices for accommodations and lack of availability for the campsites and/or lodges. Winter is also a great time to visit if you enjoy snow sports and want to experience the parks in a different light but this guide is for the spring, summer and fall.


### Travel Tips

- Book early - the lodges or the campsites, the earlier the better chance to get into. 
- Carry bear spray and know how to use it.
- If you are trying to find a more budget friendly option, I would suggest you fly to Salt Lake City. West Yellowstone visitor center is around 4.5 hours from Salt Lake City airport (SLC), and the drive is beautiful as well. 
- Plan your meals and snacks ahead of time.
- Be prepared for long drives between attractions especially in Yellowstone.
- DON'T GO OFF TRAILS specially in Yellowstone. 
- Even in summer, the temperature drops in the night, so pack warm clothes as well.




## My Personal Experience  


   <PostCard 
    src="/national-parks/yellowstone/ys_photoshoot.jpg"
    alt="Somewhere in Yellowstone" 
    caption="Somewhere in Yellowstone"

    />

I'm a through and through camping person and I love the sounds of birds and plants in and around the campsites, so every time I have been to Yellowstone or Tetons, I have always camped. My personal favorite in yellowstone is the old faithful. No matter how many times I see it erupt, it always blows my mind and I start thinking about the magic of nature. 

I haven't been to Lamar valley which is high on my list and also hopefully I get to cover more of hikes in Tetons in my next visit. so, if you have any ideas on those, send me a message on instagram. :) 

While I do enjoy luxury, I'm more of a budget traveler. My love for camping and budget traveling goes hand in hand, so it's pretty doable for me to try and keep my expenses low so that I can travel more. 

Feel free to take some food ideas and budget friendly tips from my trip that me and my husband did in August 2024. 

## Culinary Highlights 

We mostly cooked at the campsite for this trip.

**Campsite food (Please take some ideas from here)**
- Bread/ Briuse  with Guacamole and very hot Salsa
- Mango and Avocado Salad with cherry tomatoes 
- Cup Noodles with eggs and seasongings
- Ready to eat Indian food packets ( rice, pasta )

**Eating Out** 
We didn't eat out this trip, but I’d recommend trying the local cuisine at the lodges and restaurants in the park. Bison burgers and huckleberry ice cream are a must-try! I had tried them on my previous trip to Yellowstone. 

## Expenses
Here is the breakdown of our expenses for our trip, make sure to adjust it according to your preferences and needs.
- **Flight to Salt Lake City from Chicago:** $62 total for 2 people (Yes, we use frontier and we are not ashamed of it) ;)
- **Car Rental:** $127 for 3 days
- **Gas:** $130     
- **Grocery:**  $105 (camping foods, firewoods included )
- **Eating Out:** $0 
- **Accommodation:** $60 for campsites
- **Miscellaneous:** $13 (I bought a key chain souvenir )
- **Park Entrance:** We have America the beautiful. So, entering the park was free. 
- **Total** $392 for 2 people for 3 days.

We camped and cooked all of our meals, so that saved us a lot of money. 

## Final Thoughts

Exploring Yellowstone and Grand Tetons in a long weekend is a adventure in itself. The parks are so vast and diverse that you'll definitetly want to come back after the short visit to explore more. The landscape is simply mind blowing and you can co-exist and admire wildlife (from a distance) in the park. 

I hope this guide helps you plan your own trip and make the most of your time in these incredible parks. Happy travels!
