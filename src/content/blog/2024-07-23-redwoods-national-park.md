Have you ever seen the tallest trees in the world? We got to visit Redwoods National and State Parks, where you can find the tallest trees on Earth. These redwoods are like giants of the forest, and being among them felt like stepping into a whole new world.

It’s not just about how tall they are—it’s their powerful presence. Walking among these ancient trees made me feel small, but in the most amazing way. The park is so magical, with sunlight coming through the huge trees and the ground covered in soft moss. Every turn showed us something new and beautiful, and it was a fantastic experience to just enjoy the natural beauty.

We also drove along the Pacific coast, where the views were incredible. The rugged shoreline and endless ocean made the trip even more special.

Our visit to the Redwoods was one of the shorter adventures in our longer Northern California journey, but it was truly unforgettable. We stayed with a friend in Ukiah, who is a forest specialist and could only join us at the park on the weekend. His knowledge made the tree-watching even more interesting and memorable.

Here is how the trip unfolded. 

## Day 1

We drove from Ukiah along Highway 101, and the drive itself was already one of the most scenic parts of our journey, even before we reached our main destination.

**Stops**

- **Shrine Drive-Through Tree**  
Our first stop was the Shrine Drive-Through Tree. While we had a close call with our rental car navigating through this quirky, cemented tree, it was an interesting diversion. It offers a unique photo opportunity, though it leans more towards commercial charm than an authentic redwood experience

- **Humboldt State Park**  
 Home to the largest expanse of ancient redwoods. We visited the visitor center for tips on must-see trees and explored notable spots like the Big Tree and Tall Tree.

- **Avenue of Giants**  
  This scenic drive takes you through majestic redwoods. We listened to the Lord of the Rings audiobook, making the experience feel like a fantasy adventure.

- **Founders Grove**  
We explored the impressive roots of a fallen giant in Founders Grove. The sprawling roots offered a fascinating glimpse into the tree’s life and nature’s power.

- **Eureka**  
We drove through Eureka, enjoying its Victorian architecture and picturesque Humboldt Bay views.

 
**Evening:** After checking into our campsite, we watched a stunning sunset over the Pacific. The sky turned vibrant shades of orange, pink, and purple, reflecting off the tumultuous waters.

## Day 2


- **Crescent City**  
    We visited the historic lighthouse and took a leisurely walk to the pier, enjoying the coastal views and maritime history

- **Sue-meg State Park**
   We enjoyed the stunning ocean vistas and spotted playful seals along the shore. The park’s trails were perfect for a relaxing hike or picnic.

After exploring several stops along the Pacific coast, we arrived in Ukiah in the evening for another hectic work-week. 


## Expenses
Here’s a breakdown of the expenses for our trip. 
- **Car Rental:** $100 for 2 days

## What I Missed
-  **Natural Bridge in Oregon**
If you have a bit more time, consider adding the Natural Bridge in Oregon to your route. It’s a fascinating natural rock formation where the river has carved a bridge-like structure through the rock.

- **Mount Shasta**
Another option, if you have a little extra time, is to include Mount Shasta in your itinerary. The majestic, snow-capped peak offers stunning views and adds an extra touch of beauty to your journey.


## Culinary Highlights
This weekend was fueled by delicious and convenient ready-made food from Costco. We enjoyed pork ribs, pasta, and refreshing mango juice.

## Ease of Visit
We didn’t need any reservations, and the park was accessible for the most part.


## Season and Driving Conditions 
We visited in Redwoods in Summer 2024, but since it’s a Pacific coastal area, the temperatures remain fairly consistent year-round.


## Final Thoughts
Our journey through the Redwoods and along the Pacific coast was truly unforgettable. The towering trees and stunning coastal views left us in awe and provided a perfect mix of relaxation and adventure. Watching the sunset over the Pacific was a highlight, and exploring the majestic redwoods reminded us of nature’s incredible beauty. This trip was a wonderful blend of discovery and serenity, and it’s one I'll always cherish.
